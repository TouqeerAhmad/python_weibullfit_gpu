# python_weibullfit_gpu
The core functionality is based from https://github.com/mlosch/python-weibullfit -- trying to add the pre-processing of distances same as that of libmr (https://github.com/Vastlab/libMR) and making sure weibull-fits can be done for multiple instances together instead of a single fit at a time for a single instance.
